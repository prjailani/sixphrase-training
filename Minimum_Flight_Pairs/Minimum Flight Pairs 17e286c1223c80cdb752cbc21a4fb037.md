# Minimum Flight Pairs

Array Pattern: Given an array of numbers , find out the minimum distance and print all the pairs with minimum distance 

Problem 01  :Imagine you are working for an airline company that wants to optimize the travel times between cities. The airlines has a set of cities with direct flights between them and each flight has a specific duration.

You are tasked with finding paris of cities where the flight duration is the shortest and you need to display all such pairs

You are given an array of integers representing the flight duration between cities.Each index in the arry represents a sepcific city and the value at each index corresponds to the flight time( in minutes ) between the current city and another city

The array may contain duplicate flight durations, A city can have mutliple pairs with other cities that
share the minimum flight time

Sample input :

int[] flight times = {120,90,110,95,120,90}
